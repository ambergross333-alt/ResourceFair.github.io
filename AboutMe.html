                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Amber, and I am a Library and Information Science major working toward my master’s degree at UNCG. I have a passion for libraries and the important role they play in connecting people with information and each other.</p>
                <p>My goal is to work closely with the community as well as the public library system, developing programs and services that encourage lifelong learning, inclusivity, and engagement.</p>
                <p>Through my capstone project, I organized a community resource fair that brought together local organizations and residents to share information and support. This experience gave me hands-on practice in community collaboration, outreach, and program development, which I plan to continue building on in my career.</p>
